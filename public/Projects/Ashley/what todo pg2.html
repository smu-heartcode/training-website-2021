          <h1><b>What Should You Do?</b></h1>
          <br>
          <p>Depressed teens often experience significant emotional and sometimes physical pain, but may not know what to do to make it better or find the help that they need. 
              Parents are usually in the best position to take charge in getting initial help for a depressed teen. </p>
            <p>If you've noticed signs of depression in your child most days for more than a week or two, 
                your child could have depression. Here’s how to approach the topic gently and offer support.</p>
            <br>
            <ol>
                <li><h5>Ask. Keep asking.</h5></li>
                <p>Find a quiet and private place to have a conversation with your child. Try to approach the subject with just one parent, 
                    as facing two parents at once might tense the atmosphere and overwhelm your child.</p>
                <p>You can start by explaining your worries:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>“I’m wondering why you haven’t spent much time with your friends lately.”</li>
                    <li>“I’m worried because you’re sleeping much more than usual.”</li>
                    <li>“I’m concerned because you haven’t put much effort into your schoolwork lately.”</li>
                    <br>
                    <p>Then, continue with some open-ended questions</p>
                    <li>“What happened to change your mind about your friends?”</li>
                    <li>“Can you explain what’s bothering you?”</li>
                    <li>“What’s making you feel this way?”</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Asking your child these questions makes it easier to get them the right support. </p>
                <p>Of course, it's absolutely normal to feel scared and want to rush them to a mental health professional immediately. 
                    However, getting them talking first can help give you a clearer and broader picture of what’s going on.</p>
                <p>If they don’t open up the first time you ask, keep asking. If they seem reluctant to talk about depression, 
                    remind them it’s a common mental health condition, not anything they can control on their own.</p>
                <li><h5>Be ready to listen</h5></li>
                <p>When they start to open up, use active listening to help them feel heard.
                     Wrap up whatever you need to do for the day as soon as you can and try not to let the moment pass.</p>
                <p>Depression sometimes makes people feel as if they’re burdening loved ones. That means they might take a completely reasonable, 
                    “Just 5 minutes!” as a rejection and hesitate to bother you again.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Give them all of your attention.</li>
                    <li>Avoid interrupting, finishing their sentences, or filling in their pauses. 
                        Let them share in their own time, even if it takes them a while to get the words out.</li>
                    <li>Focus on their opinion, not yours.</li>
                    <li>You can summarize their response to clarify</li>
                    <li>If you don't understand , <b>just ask</b></li>
                    <p>Even if you don't understand their feelings, never invalidate them. This may seem as a sign of rejection to the individual and worsen their condition.</p>
                    <p>Instead, give comforting and validating support to them.</p>
                    <li>Help them get support</li>
                    <p>While your compassion and guidance can make a big difference for your child, 
                        professional support is typically the best way to improve symptoms.</p>
                        If they refuse therapy at first, talking to a school counselor or favorite teacher can help them get more comfortable with the idea. 
                        They might be more willing to consider therapy when other trusted adults encourage them to reach out.
                </ul>
            </ol>
