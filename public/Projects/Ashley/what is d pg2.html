          <h1><b>What is Depression?</b></h1>
            <br>
          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <br>
          <p>Depression is a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest.
            Also called major depressive disorder or clinical depression, it negatively affects how you feel, think and behave and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems.
            It can also cause feelings of sadness and/or a loss of interest in activities you once enjoyed and can decrease your ability to function at work and at home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Depression can occur at any time, but on average, first appears during the late teens to mid-20s. 
          </p>
          <p>ㅤ</p>
          <h3>Common Misconceptions</h3>
          <br>
            <ul>
                <li><h5>Depression is the same as Sadness or Grief/Beravement</h5></li>
                <br>
                <p>Events in life such as losing your job or a loved one can be diffucult for people to endure. 
                    However, in most cases, it is a part and parcel of life and is <b>not</b> considered as being "depressed", even if signs of depression are observed.
                </p>
                <p>Distinguishing between grief and depression is important and can assist people in getting the help, support or treatment they need.
                </p>
                <br>
                <li><h5>Depression is a sign of weakness</h5></li>
                <br>
                <p>Depression is <b>not</b> a sign of weakness but a medical condition due to the chemical imbalance in the brain that can be treated.
                </p>
                <p>Depression is unrelated to the strength of a someones' character; it is a serious medical condition like asthma or diabetes. It is often triggered by major life events that may be challenging to cope with, e.g., the loss of a loved one, loss of job, etc.
                </p>
                <br>
                <li><h5>Depression is temporary and will go away by itself</h5></li>
                <br>
                <p>Depression is a a medical condition diagnosed by professionals and needs treatment and support for it to be cured.
                    In fact, symptoms of depression may worsen if untreated. Thus, it is important to seek help early to prevent depressive symptoms from getting worse.
                </p>
            </ul>
