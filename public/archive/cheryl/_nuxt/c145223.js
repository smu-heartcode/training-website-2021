He became a notoriously confusing lecturer who had numerous affairs and was outspoken on political issues, showing signs of Asperger syndrome. \r\n      He struggled with his studies, and wasn’t able to speak fluently even at the age of nine. When Einstein entered Secondary School, he showed a bad attitude towards his classes causing him to be expelled. As an adult, his lectures were confusing and he needed his wives to act as parents when he was an adult. He was also the stereotypical “absent-minded professor” as he was often forgetful of everyday items such as keys. He would also focus so intently on solving physics problems so often he would become oblivious to his surroundings. He then searched for jobs and started working as an assistant examiner at the “Federal office for Intellectual Property” in Bern, Switzerland. Einstein was responsible for the evaluation of the patent submission for many inventions. \r\n      "),n("br"),e._v(" "),n("br"),e._v(" Despite everything, Einstein became the most influential physicist of the 20th century. Even as an Autistic child he managed to write 4-papers that were printed in the Scientific journal “Annalen der Physik”. This paper contributed to the amazing work of modern physics and changed the point of view of people on time, mass, space and energy. These papers presented the concept of Photoelectric effect, mass-energy equivalence, special theory of relativity and Brownian motion. In 1907, he gave the concept of gravity. According to him, gravity is equivalent to the accelerated motion. His image as a scientist had been improved and he was invited to present lectures at one of the most popular universities in the world named “University of Bern”. He also won the Nobel Prize awards in 1921 due to his services in theoretical physics and the discovery of the law of the “Photoelectric Effect”, hence becoming the most influential physicist of the 20th century and worldwide famous scientist.\r\n  "),n("div",{staticClass:"credits"},[n("br"),e._v("Credits: "),n("br"),e._v(" https://medium.com/@joshcanonoy/success-story-of-albert-einstein-the-great-scientist-and-physicist-d58baa02ba89\r\n "),n("br"),e._v(" https://www.britannica.com/biography/Albert-Einstein \r\n  ")])]),e._v(" "),n("myfooter")],1)}),[],!1,null,"65c56b55",null);t.default=component.exports;installComponents(component,{NavigationBar:n(200).default,Myfooter:n(201).default})}}]);
