Everybody at school picked on me because I was different – I had white hair and a boy’s name. “My shyness was probably made worse because of my condition. I’d come home from school and cry myself to sleep. Right from an early age, I’d rock myself back and forth because it helped calm me down. “Kids bullied me and that just drove me further into myself. Children can be very cruel when they see someone who doesn’t fit in – and unfortunately, that was me. I didn’t fit in anywhere.” Thus, her mother withdrew Daryl from school and kept her at home for a year, letting her exist in her imaginary world but slowly easing her back to reality. \r\n"),o("br"),e._v(" "),o("br"),e._v(" To her saving grace, Daryl says, was the discovery that acting could provide a vehicle for her vivid imagination.\r\n“I was about 11 when I understood that movies weren’t something that just happened in reality and someone caught it on camera,” says Daryl. “Once I realised that it was actually a job I could have, I actively pursued it.
